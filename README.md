## Inspiration & Goal - The Story Behind Shaky üí°
In 2023, Turkey and Syria were rocked by a devastating earthquake, followed by over 30,000 aftershocks. The catastrophe affected more than 14 million people, resulting in widespread damage and loss of life.<br>
My brother shared stories of some friends too frightened to sleep, worried they wouldn't have time to respond to potential tremors.

To assist them facing such situations, he inspired me to create an app. This app should provide peace of mind by detecting vibrations and alerting the user to take precautions.<br>
So, I set out to create **Shaky**. My goal was to design an app that anyone could use effortlessly anywhere, ensuring that everyone could benefit from its capabilities.

<br>

## Quick Start üöÄ
**Clone** the Repository or **Download Shaky** from Play Store, and **Run** the app on your device or emulator.
1. **Start Detection:** The detector will start monitoring **automatically**.
2. **Enable Notifications:** Upon opening the app, grant permission for notifications.
This allows Shaky to alert you when vibrations are detected.
- **To Stop Detection:** Tap the *OFF* button at the middle of the screen.
- **Set Sensitivity:** Adjust the sensitivity level of the vibration detector with the *Sensitivity slider*. More instructions in the [Usage](#usage) section.
- **Adjust Alarm Volume:** Set the volume level for the alert alarm.
Choose a volume that ensures you'll wake up or be alerted during vibrations.

<br>

## Usage üì±
- **Multilingual support:** Available in **English**, **Arabic**, and **Turkish**.
It correspondes to your device language.
- **Monitoring Vibrations:** After openning Shaky, it will start monitoring vibrations **automatically**.
Keep the app running in the background, and it will continuously detect any vibrations.
- You can **return** to Shaky effortlessly through its **Notification**.

Interacting with the Main Screen:
   - **Status Indicator:** Check the status indicator on the main screen to see if the app is actively monitoring vibrations.
   - **Start/Stop Detection:** Use the *ON/OFF* buttons to start or stop vibration monitoring.
   - **Adjust Sensitivity:** Slide the Sensitivity slider to customize the detector's sensitivity level.<br>
   Start with the maximum sensitivity and adjust it gradually to suit your preference. You can increase sensitivity to detect weaker vibrations or decrease it to avoid false alarms.
   - **Adjust Alarm Volume:** Slide the *Alarm volume slider* to set your preferred alarm volume level.
   - **Access Additional Functions:** Tap the button on the bottom right corner of the main screen to access more functions.
   
Accessing Additional Features:
